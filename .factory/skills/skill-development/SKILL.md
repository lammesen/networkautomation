Guidance for writing Factory Droid skills. **Use sequentialThinking.**

Layout: `.factory/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with frontmatter (name, third-person description with trigger phrases) and concise body; optional `references/` or `examples/` for details.

Body essentials: purpose, when to use, key steps, verification, safety notes, pointers to references. Keep imperative voice and minimal length; push long examples to references.

Avoid vague triggers, second-person wording, or oversized SKILL.md. See `references/skill-patterns.md` and `examples/` for templates.
