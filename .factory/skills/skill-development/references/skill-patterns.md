Skill patterns quick notes
==========================
- Frontmatter must include name and clear trigger-style description (third person).
- SKILL.md stays lean: purpose, when to use, core steps, verification, safety/escalation, reference pointers.
- Use bullets/imperative voice; omit filler; keep code snippets short.
- Move long examples to references/examples; note required tools explicitly if needed.
- Keep compatibility with other project guides (tenant scoping, RBAC, sequentialThinking).
