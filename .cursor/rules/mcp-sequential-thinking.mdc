# Sequential Thinking MCP

**When to use:**
- **MANDATORY** for ALL non-trivial tasks (per core principles)
- Complex problems requiring step-by-step analysis
- Multi-step implementations needing planning
- Debugging complex issues
- Architecture decisions

**How to use:**
```typescript
mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Current thinking step",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})
```

**Why:**
- Structures problem-solving process
- Prevents jumping to solutions without analysis
- Documents reasoning chain
- Helps identify edge cases early

**Pattern:**
1. Start with `totalThoughts` estimate
2. Build thoughts incrementally
3. Revise if needed (`isRevision: true`)
4. Generate solution hypothesis
5. Verify before implementing
